Hi! 👋 I am currently a second-year M.S. student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) majoring in Computer Science. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, I am interested in developing <i>learning methods</i> that are <i>effective in resource-constrained scenarios</i>. Additionally, I am interested in <i>NLP applications</i> that have a <i>positive impact on society</i>. With these research interests, my overarching goal is to make NLP <i>accessible and inclusive</i> for everyone. While at Georgia Tech, I have been fortunate to be advised by [Alan Ritter](http://aritter.github.io), [Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org), [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/), [Mrinamaya Sachan](http://www.mrinmaya.io), and [Saif Mohammad](https://www.saifmohammad.com) on projects relevant to this long-term goal.

Previously, as an applied scientist at [Walmart India](https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-business/international/walmart-india), I researched speech recognition and synthesis for Indic languages and developed an [interactive voice assistant](https://stories.flipkart.com/use-voice-assistant-to-buy-groceries-flipkart/) to make e-commerce <i>accessible</i> to non-tech savvy people. Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [IIT Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in), where I ranked second in my class. To know more about me, please check out my CV linked above.

Besides research, I enjoy reading 📚 (stoic philosophy and biographies), running 🏃‍♂️ (3x half-marathon, 02:05:44 being my fastest), marital arts 🥋 (practicing Northern Shaolin Kung Fu), and music 🎶 (post/hard rock and Sufi). I also like dabbling with languages on Duolingo, currently learning Chinese (你 好!).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
